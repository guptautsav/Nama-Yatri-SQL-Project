# Nama-Yatri-SQL-Project
Project Title: Namma Yatri Ride Sharing Analysis

Description: Developed a comprehensive SQL-based analysis of ride-sharing data using MySQL Workbench. 
The project focused on analyzing trip metrics, driver performance, earnings, and customer behavior for the Namma Yatri platform. Key queries executed included total trips, completed trips, earnings, average fare per trip,
most-used payment methods, and top-earning drivers. The analysis also covered cancellation rates, search-to-booking conversion rates, and trip distributions by time and location, providing actionable insights into ride-sharing operations.
